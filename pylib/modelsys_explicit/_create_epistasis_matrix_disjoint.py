    """Generate a matrix specifying epistatic interactions between genome
    sites, allowing each site to have at most one epistatic interaction.

    Epistatic redundancy is modeled as sets of n sites tagged with a common
    epistatic set label.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_sites : int
        Number of genome sties
    num_epistatic_sets : int
        The number of epistatic sets to be created.
    epistatic_set_size : int
        The size of each epistatic set.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Arrangement of epistatic redundancy labels, where columns correspond to
        genome sites and there is only a single row.

    Notes
    -----
    - Epistatic set labels are indexed starting from 1 to distinguish from
      empty zeros.

    --------
