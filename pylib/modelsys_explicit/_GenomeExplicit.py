        Parameters
        ----------
        knockout_effects : typing.Sequence[typing.Callable]
            A sequence of functions, each modeling a different knockout effect
            on the genome.

            Knockout effect functions should take a knockout a binary mask
            representing knockout sites, where 1 indicates site knockout.
            Functions should return float value indicating fitness effect,
            with deleterious effects positive, advantageous effects negative,
            and neutral effects zero.


            Net fitness effect is calculated as the sum of individual effects'
            results. Fitness effects are considered detectable only with
            absolute value greater than or equal to 1.
        assay_artifacts : typing.Sequence[typing.Callable], optional
            A sequence of functions representing various assay artifacts, by
            default an empty tuple.

        Parameters
        ----------
        knockout : np.array
            A binary array representing knockout sites, where 1 indicates site
            knockout.

            Length of array corresponds to genome size, i.e., one entry per

        int
            1 if the cumulative effect of the knockouts is detectably
            deleterious, -1 if cumulative effects of knockouts is detectably
