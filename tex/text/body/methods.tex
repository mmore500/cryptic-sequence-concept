\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

% For initial tests of proposed, we used a simple genome model where sites had explicitly ascribed effects.
% This allowed us to design trials with known effects in genomes and then assess the capability assays to recover this information.
% Effects were assigned randomly, to genome sites and multiple effects were allowed to overlap on the same site.
% When evaluating the knockout effects on a genome, we summed constituent effects and defined a deleterious outcome if these effects summed to a value greater than 1.0.
% Additive sites contributed a constant amount TODOAMOUNT to the sum if knocked out.
% Epistatic sites are created in sets of TODOAMOUNT sites, and an effect of TODO was only accured if all sites in a set were knocked out.
